## Hi there 👋, I'm Lihle

I'm a computer enginnering student in South Africa, passionate about building practical, user-friendly applications. 

Currently I'm working on various projects from 2D game development, Budgeting App to Chat Application. I'm currently at the stage in which I'm exploring various fields in Software designing to figure out where i want to position myself as such I'm trying out a lot of things at this time. 

My main tech stack currently are C and Java, with Blender and Godot as secondary(status: learning). The tools are Obsidian, Apple notes, blender, Godot and my IDE Apache Netbean and CodeBlocks.
